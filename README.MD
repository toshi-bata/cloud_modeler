### Environment valiables
Register the following enviroment valiables<br>
    Name: `PS_SERVER_WORKING_DIR`   Value: C:\temp\PsServer\ (Create the folder if it doen't exist)

### PsServer
PsServer is a server side console application which is using HOOPS Exchange, Parasolid. <br>
\* As of now, it will works on Windows only<br>
If you want to build PsServer, <br>
1. Edit `cloud_modeler\PsServer\HC_VS2019.bat` according to your environment
2. Launch the `PsServer.sln` solution with VS2019 using the above bat file
3. Build the console application project

## Start cloud_modeler
1. Launch HTTP server using a command prompt<br>
    `cd â€¦/cloud_modeler`<br>
    `npm install`<br>
    `npm start`<br>
2. Start PsServer.exe 8889 (giving a port number in command line argument)
3. Open (using Chrome)<br>
